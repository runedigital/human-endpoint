## The Problem

Every day, 100 million people start a new conversation with ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.

And every single time, they say the same thing:

> "I'm a developer. I use Python and React. I want concise answers. I'm working on a SaaS product. I'm a solo founder with no budget for complex solutions..."

**They repeat themselves. Every. Single. Chat.**

The AI has amnesia. The human pays the tax.

---

## The Solution

**Human Endpoint** — a portable, universal context seed encoded in a URL.

One link. Works on every AI. Forever.

```
humanendpoint.io/seed?name=Joel&role=founder&stack=python,react&style=expert&goals=ship_fast&constraints=solo_founder
```

User pastes the link. AI reads it. Conversation starts at mile 10, not mile 0.

---

## How It Works

1. **User fills a form** (30 seconds)
   - Role, tech stack, communication style, goals, constraints

2. **We generate a URL**
   - All context is encoded in the URL parameters
   - No database. No account. No login.

3. **User pastes URL into any AI chat**
   - ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot — all of them can fetch URLs
   - AI parses the context instantly

4. **AI "knows" them from the first message**

---

## Why Now?

- **Dec 2024**: Claude gained web fetching
- **2024**: ChatGPT browsing became standard
- **2025**: Gemini, Copilot, Grok — all fetch URLs now

For the first time in history, **every major AI can read a URL**.

The infrastructure is ready. The product didn't exist.

Until now.

## Competitive Landscape

| Solution | Portable? | Universal? | User-Owned? |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| ChatGPT Memory | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Claude Projects | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Custom Instructions | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

## Moat

1. **Network Effects** — 100K users with saved links = switching cost
2. **Brand** — "What's your Human Endpoint?" becomes the question
3. **Open Standard** — Publish the spec, become the RFC author
4. **Speed** — We ship weekly while Google has committee meetings
5. **Data** — Analytics on AI consumption patterns (valuable to researchers)

---

## Exit Paths

1. **Acquisition** — Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft
   - They need portable identity. We have it.
   - Comparable: Linktree ($1.3B valuation)

2. **Platform** — Become the identity layer for AI
   - Every AI tool integrates Human Endpoint
   - Auth0 for AI context

3. **Data Business** — Anonymized insights on AI usage patterns
   - "How do developers use AI differently than marketers?"
   - Sell to researchers, enterprises

## The Ask

This isn't a fundraise. This is a proof of concept.

**What I need:**
- $30 for the domain
- 1 weekend to polish
- 1 viral tweet

**What you get:**
- First-mover advantage in a category that doesn't exist yet
- A product that sells itself when people share their URLs
- Zero CAC — every link shared is free marketing
